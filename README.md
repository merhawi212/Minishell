## Signals

Minishell handles signals gracefully, including the following:

- Ctrl+C (SIGINT): Used to interrupt a running command.
- Ctrl+D (EOF): Signals the end of input.
- Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT): Triggers a core dump and can be used to exit the shell with a core dump.

Feel free to explore these signals while using Minishell.
